# Adventure assignment

Build your own text adventure using Python.

This assignment is based on the original Java version in [CS106A](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs106a/), at that time led by [Mehran Sahami](https://profiles.stanford.edu/mehran-sahami), which was likely based on the assignment by [John Estell](http://nifty.stanford.edu/2002/EstellNifty2002/) who submitted a [Nifty Assignment](http://nifty.stanford.edu) in 2002.
